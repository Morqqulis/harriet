                     Harriet’s career has been defined by building the foundations of AI security from every angle — government, industry, startups, research, and education. She began at Deloitte
                     Australia, specialising on defence projects ranging from data remediation for Navy systems to AI and automation initiatives in the Navy and Air Force.

                     She then worked as a data scientist at the University of Physics Department, modelling the movement of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black dwarfs. From there, she moved to New
                     York City to join a startup where she delivered training on cybersecurity and AI to Fortune 500 organisations across North America.

                     Returning to Australia, Harriet joined the Australian Signals Directorate, working across three teams before becoming Acting Technical Director of the AI Hub — where she helped
                     lead
                     AI development in national security and intelligence contexts and worked closely with Five Eyes partners.

                  <p>
                     Alongside this, Harriet completed a Master’s in Cyber Security, a Data Science certificate at Stanford University, and a PhD in Machine Learning Security. In 2023 she founded
                     Mileva Security Labs to bring the same level of rigour and seriousness applied in national security into the broader public and private sectors.

                  <p>
                     Through Mileva, she led the development of the first AI security framework in an Australian government department outside of national security, and created the first mandatory AI
                     security training program in an Australian organisation. Mileva now operates from both Australia and London, enabling Harriet to expand her mission globally.

                     Her work has been profiled by Vogue Australia, she has been part of prestigious accelerators such as UNSW Founders 10x, and she has spoken on the main stage at DEF CON about her
                     research. She has also featured in Microsoft’s L33t Speak series and delivered AI security training to global organisations including HSBC, Mastercard, and Lenovo.

                  <p>
                     She has won several prestigious grants with government and AI organisations, including the Future of Life Institute, to advance her research on AI security.

                     To further broaden access, Harriet created the AI Security Fundamentals course — designed around her belief that training should be interactive and community-driven, combining
                     self-paced learning with live facilitator-led seminars. Why should it be boring when it can be fun?
