               Harriet Farlow is the CEO and Founder of Mileva Security Labs, Australia’s first AI security company.
            </p>
            <p>
               With a PhD in Machine Learning Security and her upcoming book, she is dedicated to building AI security into a field that can rise to one of the world’s greatest technical and
               geostrategic challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
               Harriet’s mission is clear: to make AI security stronger, more equitable, and more inclusive than the technical fields that came before it — a discipline that values creativity and
               diverse perspectives as much as technical rigour.
            </p>
            <p>
               She believes AI security will eventually surpass cybersecurity in importance, and that now is our chance to shape the field into something better.
            </p>
            <p>
               She rejects the divide between “technical” and “non-technical,” insisting that everyone has something worthwhile to contribute.
            </p>
            <p>
               Everything she does — from research and teaching to writing and advocacy — is about investing in this mission: creating the AI security field we need to secure the future of artificial
               intelligence
