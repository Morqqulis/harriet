                     I was born in Canberra, Australia, but now I live wherever I happen to be that week! I've travelled to 50 countries and have working rights in the UK, USA and Australia so you
                     never know where in the world you might find me..

                     I either wanted to be an astrophysicist or an author. I'm lucky enough to say now that I've kind of been both! It has been really hard starting a business but I'm lucky enough to
                     say that now I'm living my dream - I don't want to be rich in money, I just want to rich and experience and do work that makes the world a better place.

                     I've always been a big reader, and my favourite way to spend an afternoon is to have a nice place to sit with my book and endless stream of coffee (but it must be Australian-grade
                     coffee). I also love doing pilates - I'm actually a qualified instructor!
